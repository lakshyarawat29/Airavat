# Airavat

**Airavat** is a proof-of-concept developed for the SuRaksha hackathon under Theme 2: _Securing Sensitive Customer Data in Fintech Ecosystems with Responsible Data Sharing and Privacy Protection_. It leverages AI agents, zero-trust architecture, blockchain, and privacy-enhancing technologies to protect sensitive customer data (e.g., bank details, transaction histories) while enabling secure and compliant data sharing in fintech ecosystems.

## Overview

Airavat addresses the challenge of securing sensitive customer data in fintech platforms, particularly during third-party data sharing. It ensures compliance with regulations like GDPR and India's DPDP Act, minimizes data exposure, enforces usage boundaries, and fosters user trust through transparency and ethical data handling.

## Architecture

Airavat employs a multi-agent system where each agent performs a specific role in the secure data-sharing workflow:

- **Verification and Risk Assessment Agent (VRA)**: Verifies requests and assesses risks using machine learning.
- **Request Builder Agent (RBA)**: Determines what data to share based on request analysis.
- **Task Master Agent (TMA)**: Orchestrates the workflow and coordinates agents.
- **Data Retrieval Agent (DRA)**: Handles secure data lookup and retrieval.
- **Zero-Knowledge Builder Agent (ZKBA)**: Implements zero-knowledge protocols for privacy.
- **Blockchain Builder Agent (BBA)**: Logs transactions to a blockchain for auditability.
- **Output Control Agent (OCA)**: Formats and delivers responses.
- **Time-Lock Server Agent (TLSA)**: Performs secondary risk checks for the Time-Lock Server.
- **Time-Lock Server (TLS)**: Stores data with time-bound access.

## Components

- **AI Agents**: Built with LangChain for policy enforcement and anomaly detection.
- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Enforces strict access control with continuous verification.
- **Blockchain**: Uses Hyperledger Fabric for immutable audit trails.
- **Privacy-Enhancing Technologies**: Incorporates differential privacy (OpenDP) and homomorphic encryption (Microsoft SEAL).
- **User Interface**: Provides consent management and admin dashboards.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the Airavat development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justAbhinav/Airavat
   cd Airavat
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Install Docker for Hyperledger Fabric:
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
     sh get-docker.sh
     ```
   - Install Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install docker-compose  # Or equivalent for your OS
     ```

4. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with required values (e.g., API keys, blockchain config).

5. **Run Blockchain Network**:
   - Navigate to `blockchain/` and follow the Hyperledger Fabric setup instructions (TBD in `blockchain/README.md`).

## Usage

- **Start the System**:
  ```bash
  python main.py  # Placeholder; update with actual startup script
  ```
- **Testing**: Use synthetic data in `tests/` to simulate requests and validate functionality.
- **Monitoring**: Check logs and blockchain entries for auditing.
